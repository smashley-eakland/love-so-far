#### In honor of Valentine's Day, *insert reader groans here*, I thought I would write my blog post for phase 4 on a fun social project that I stumbled across recently called the Love So Far project, but with a twist using the Folium Library in Python. This is the repository hosting the notebook and code featured in the blog write up. If you'd care to read the blog and give me a follow, I'd greatly appreciate it! Take a look at the blog post [here!](https://medium.com/@smashley_eakland/love-so-far-an-interactive-view-add3c01a7ab9?source=friends_link&sk=78cf6d1e57d4f7541c037ae9d3cddc09).
